# Narfolio

## Description

For this project, I was tasked with making a portfolio in the form of a responsive website. To the best of my ability, I tried to make the site look like the demo, with personal touched added. All the image links will lead to the 1st assignments repository. I was also running short on time, so throughout the HTML and CSS I tried to comment with what I struggled with.
